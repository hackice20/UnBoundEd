# UnBoundEd - Unbounded Education

## Brief Project Description

UnBoundEd (Unbounded Education) – Learning without limits.
In today’s world, access to quality education remains a challenge for students in areas with
low-resource devices and limited network connectivity. Our solution is a lightweight, AI-
powered online education platform designed to function seamlessly in such environments.

Key Features:

- ✅ Offline Support – Students can download lessons (text & video) and sync progress when
online.
- ✅ AI-Powered Assistance – Smart AI tutors provide personalized learning recommendations
and instant Q&A support.
- ✅ Lightweight UI & Optimized Performance – Minimalist design ensures smooth operation on
low-end devices and slow networks.
- ✅ Micro-Certifications & Leaderboard – Learners earn digital certifications and compete in a
gamified ranking system.
- ✅ Learn-to-Earn Model – Students receive discounts or rewards for course completions,
making education more affordable.
- ✅ Community Support – Peer-to-peer learning, mentor matching, and discussion forums
enhance collaboration.

Our platform ensures inclusive and scalable learning, empowering students with minimal data
consumption and maximum engagement. 🚀

### **Explanation:**
1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - For **public routes** (e.g., `GET /api/courses` and `GET /api/courses/:id`), no authentication is needed.
   - **Admin routes** (e.g., `POST /api/courses` and `PUT /api/courses/:id`) require **authentication** (JWT token) and **admin privileges** (`isAdmin` middleware).

2. **Parameters**:
   - `username`, `password`, `email` for login and registration.
   - `courseName`, `youtubeLinks`, `quizLink`, and `discordLink` for course creation and updates.
   - `courseName` and `username` for generating certificates.

3. **Response**:
   - Most API calls return a `200 OK` status along with the required data (e.g., course list, certificate).
   - The `POST` requests for creating a course or user will return a `201 Created` status.
   - The `GET /api/certificate` returns a **PDF certificate** upon success.
